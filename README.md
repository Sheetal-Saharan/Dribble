# Dribble
Dribbble is a community and platform for designers to showcase their work, connect with other creatives, and find design inspiration. It allows designers to share snapshots of their projects, known as "shots," which can include anything from user interface designs and illustrations to typography and branding work. The platform is widely used by graphic designers, web designers, and other visual artists to network, get feedback, and discover new trends in design. In addition to showcasing work, Dribbble offers job listings and freelance opportunities, helping designers find potential clients or employment. It also features design-related discussions, resources, and tools to support the creative community
